# Multiple Disease Prediction System 
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's) using medical datasets, employing  SVM (Support Vector Machine) and  Logistic Regression algorithms, and an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

# Project Overview
This project aims to provide an easy-to-use system for predicting diseases using machine learning. By analyzing medical datasets, the system offers early diagnosis for:

## Diabetes
## Heart Disease
## Parkinson's Disease
