# Multiple Disease Prediction System 
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's) using medical datasets, employing  SVM (Support Vector Machine) and  Logistic Regression algorithms, and an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

# Project Overview
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Load datasets for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's.
- Clean and normalize data.

2.Feature Selection:
- Identify relevant features for each disease.
  
3. Model Training:
- Train SVM and Logistic Regression models for each dataset.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
  
4. Streamlit Integration:
- Create an intuitive user interface for input and prediction.

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease
